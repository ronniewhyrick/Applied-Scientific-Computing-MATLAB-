# Applied-Scientific-Computing-MATLAB-
Intro Project: Accuracy Vs. Precision
This was the intro project for my Applied Scientific Computing class where we were introduced to MATLAB. In this project we used an example CSV and simple matlab plotting to understand the differences and importance of distinguishment between Accuracy and Precision.  
by using ratios of change we were able to formulate data to give a better understanding of any sets true error and deviation from "Average"
***Note as this was a homework assignment and i'm giving you the same pdf i turned in, there are a couple of unnecessary pieces of information with no context however the coding and subsequent plots displayed respresent the concepts described in line 3 and 2 using an example plot of Temperatures.
